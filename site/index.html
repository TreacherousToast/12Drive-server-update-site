  <center><h3>12Drive Server project</p></center>
  <h4>What is 12Drive?</h4>
  <p>12Drive is an experimental server project made in the UHill computer lab. 
    It consists of 3 computers in a LAN each connected to 4 drives (hence the name 12Drive). 
    It was made to offer a high-capacity data storage solution that isn't run by Google, Amazon, Microsoft, or Dropbox.
  12Drive also uses only open-source software, running Lubuntu on each computer, using OpenSSH to communicate and send files between servers, and using Samba as a server management utility.</p>
  <br>
  <h4>Goals</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Use only parts found in the UHill computer lab</li>
    <li>Have a web interface where users can upload and download files</li>
    <li>Have a minimum 24-hour uptime for each cycle</li>
    </ul>
  <br>
  <h4>Updates</h4>
  <p>4/30/2019: The Samba filesystem was set up and is now running, so the server can be used as a Windows network share on its own LAN.</p>
  <br>
  <h4>To-do list</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Make case for server</li>
    <li>Make client-side web interface</li>
    <li>Make cooling system for drives</li>
    <li>(Maybe) Set up remote temperature monitoring for drives</li>
    <li>(Maybe) Make remote power-on system</li>
    </ul>
