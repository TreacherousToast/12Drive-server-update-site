  <center><h3>12Drive Server project</p></center>
  <h4>What is 12Drive?</h4>
  <p>12Drive is an experimental server project made in the UHill computer lab. 
    It consists of 3 computers in a LAN each connected to 4 drives (hence the name 12Drive). 
    It was made to offer a high-capacity data storage solution that isn't run by Google, Amazon, Microsoft, or Dropbox.
  12Drive also uses only open-source software, running Lubuntu on each computer, using OpenSSH to communicate and send files between servers, and using Samba as a server management utility.</p>
  <br>
  <h4>Updates</h4>
  <p>4/30/2019: The Samba filesystem was set up and is now running, so the server can be used as a Windows network share on its own LAN.</p>
